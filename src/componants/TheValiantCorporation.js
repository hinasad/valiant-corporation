                <h3>Who We Are?</h3>
                <h2>THE VALIANT CORPORATION</h2>
                <p>commenced its operation in July 2002 as a proprietary engineering service providing firm under the name of Systems & Solutions .As a services providing company we provide the industry with advanced solutions to their problems with DCS, PLCs and other Control Systems. We have vast experience in automation from having worked on several local and international projects; we jointly worked with Honeywell Middle-East and Honeywell Singapore, Fletcher & Smith UK and Bundaberg Foundry Engineers Australia as their counterparts and sub- contractors, including Natural gas liquefying facility of GASCO LNG (Abu-Dhabi), Arab Pipelines (Egypt), Brunei LNG, Wallâ€™s Ice Cream (Lahore, Pakistan)</p>
                <p>THE VALIANT CORPORATION provides engineering solutions to industrial processes in the area of Automation and Control. Yet, we go the extra mile to study the process requirements rather than just supplying and Commissioning a list of field instruments and a control system. Our current scope includes Projects done on Turnkey basis and Maintenance at various Process Plants in Pakistan based on Honeywell, Siemens and Haiwell Control System</p>
